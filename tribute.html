				About Nikola
			</h1>
			<p>
				Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in 
                Smiljan, Croatia.<br><br>
				He studied math and physics at the 
                Technical University of Graz and philosophy 
                at the University of Prague.<br><br>
                In 1882, he came up with the idea for a brushless 
                AC motor, making the first sketches of its rotating 
                electromagnets in the sand of the path. 
                Later that year he moved to Paris and got 
                a job repairing direct current (DC) power 
                plants with the Continental Edison Company. 
                Two years later he immigrated to the United States.<br><br>
				He arrived in New York in 1884 and was hired 
                as an engineer at Thomas Edison’s Manhattan headquarters.<br><br>
				In 1887 and 1888 he was granted more than 30 patents 
                for his inventions and invited to address 
                the American Institute of Electrical Engineers on 
                his work. His lecture caught the attention of 
                George Westinghouse, the inventor who had 
                launched the first AC power system near Boston 
                and was Edison’s major competitor in the 
                “Battle of the Currents<br><br>
                In 1887, Tesla met two investors who agreed to 
                back the formation of the Tesla Electric Company. 
                He set up a laboratory in Manhattan, where he developed 
                the alternating current induction motor, which solved a 
                number of technical problems that had bedeviled other designs. 
                When Tesla demonstrated his device at an engineering meeting, 
                the Westinghouse Company made arrangements to license the 
                technology, providing an upfront payment and royalties on each 
                horsepower generated<br>
				In the 1890s Tesla invented electric oscillators, 
                meters, improved lights and the high-voltage transformer 
                known as the <strong>“Tesla coil ”</strong>
                He also experimented with X-rays, gave short-range demonstrations 
                of radio communication two years before 
                Guglielmo Marconi and piloted a radio-controlled 
                boat around a pool in Madison Square Garden. 
                Together, Tesla and Westinghouse lit the 1893 World’s 
                Columbian Exposition in Chicago and partnered with 
                General Electric to install AC generators at Niagara 
                Falls, creating the first modern power station.

				<br><br> In 1895 Tesla’s New York lab burned, 
                destroying years’ worth of notes and equipment.<br><br>
                Tesla relocated to Colorado Springs 
                for two years, returning to New York in 1900.<br><br> 
                Tesla lived his last decades in a New York hotel, 
                working on new inventions even as his energy 
                and mental health faded<br><br>
                He spent his final years feeding—and, 
                he claimed, communicating with—the city’s pigeons.<br><br>
                Tesla died in his room on January 7, 1943<br><br>
